Python implementation of the co clustering algorithm based on https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/a24c8b46/sklearn/cluster/bicluster.py and https://gist.github.com/iandanforth/5862470.

To run the program, you need to have Python3, numpy, matplotlib, scipy and sklearn installed on your machine.

The algorithm itself does not require the sklearn library, we use it only to create the data, compare and evaluate our algorithm.
